* cljfmt-v2
** Fixes / robustness
*** pre-commit
**** If the current commit is apply-local-formatting*, check it is not pushed
**** Check the top stash
***** After you do the tidying up to get rid of it at the end
****** Check top stash is not '_created-by-nomis-post-commit-hook-xxxx'
** Send error echo output to stderr
** Deal with errors
*** set -e
**** Apparently set -e is not necessarily a good thing
***** See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
**** If you do use it
***** See https://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/shell-error-handling
****** eg For things that are allowed to error:
xxxx || true

*** Some stuff moved from the code
#### TODO Need to re-apply the stash if an error happened.
####      And probably in other cases too.
** Stash everything, keeping staged changes
** Consider using tags or branches for the tool's work (rather than commits)
** Work out how to deal with nested calls to the hooks
*** Something non-flaky
** Scenarios to deal with
*** A table
| Current commit           | Repo state | Action |
|--------------------------+------------+--------|
| "apply-local-formatting" | Clean      |        |
| "apply-local-formatting" | Dirty      |        |
| Something else           | Clean      |        |
| Something else           | Dirty      |        |

*** Details
**** In pre-push hook
***** Check that no un-pushed commit is "apply-local-formatting"
**** In pre-commit hook
***** If current commit is "apply-local-formatting"
****** Check that the commit is not pushed
***** If current commit is not "apply-local-formatting"
****** Apply cljfmt formatting
**** In post-commit hook
***** If we are not in a recursive call of this hook
****** If HEAD~1 commit is "apply-local-formatting"
******* Assert that HEAD~1 is not pushed
******** (maybe; this was checked in pre-commit hook)
******* Replace HEAD~1 with a cljfmt-version of current files
******** Apply cljfmt formatting
******** Stage and commit the changes
git add .
git commit --no-verify --allow-empty -m "apply-cljfmt-formatting"
******** Combine the previous 3 commits
        git reset --soft HEAD~3 &&
            git commit --edit -m"$(git log --format=%B --reverse HEAD..HEAD@{1})"
******* Set files and git status to as they were
******** Is this possible?
********* I think you can set worktree with this:
********** git checkout [<tree-ish>] [--] <pathspec>...
********** But can't distinguish untracked files, I think
******* Create an "apply-local-formatting" commit
