* cljfmt-v2
** Need to look at what happens when there is no remote set up
** Make sure error messages go to stderr
*** See planck.core/*err*

** Fixes / robustness
*** pre-commit
**** If the current commit is apply-local-formatting*, check it is not pushed
**** Check the top stash
***** After you do the tidying up to get rid of it at the end
****** Check top stash is not '_created-by-nomis-post-commit-hook-xxxx'
** Deal with errors
*** Some stuff moved from the code
#### TODO Need to re-apply the stash if an error happened.
####      And probably in other cases too.
*** Errors in bash
**** set -e
***** Apparently set -e is not necessarily a good thing
****** See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
***** If you do use it
****** See https://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/shell-error-handling
******* eg For things that are allowed to error:

** Stash everything, keeping staged changes
** Consider using tags or branches for the tool's work (rather than commits)
** Work out how to deal with nested calls to the hooks
*** Something non-flaky
